<h1>Don Slovenkai</h1>

<img src="Don-photo-wide.png" width=200 "px">

<p>Don Slovenkai is a student in the Coding Bootcamp.  Many moons ago, when he was still a lad, he spent an entire year in a programming certificate course.  He learned how to code in arcane languages like COBOL, Basic, and Fortran.  He still remembers that Fortran is short for "formula translation." Most of his teachers in that program are long retired or dead.  But Don continues to learn to code, this time for the Web!</p>
